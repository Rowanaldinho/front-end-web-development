<h1>Imagine</h1>    
    
<p>Imagine there's no heaven
    It's easy if you try
    No hell below us
    Above us only sky
    Imagine all the people
    Living for today... Aha-ah...</p>

<p>Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace... You...</p>

<p>You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one</p>

<p>Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world... You...</p>

<p>You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one</p>
